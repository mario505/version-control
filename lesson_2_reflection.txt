What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The directory where I did the commit becomes accesible to commits and versioning,
	which is essential for version control
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is unique because it allows to me control manually wich files I will
	use for my commits, and it offers me the option to customize how I want to do the 
	commits in my projects
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	With the staging area, i can control wich files to commit, so I'ts possible to only commit the files that I need
	to make the logical change I'm doing
