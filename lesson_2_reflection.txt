What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The directory where I did the commit becomes accesible to commits and versioning,
	which is essential for version control
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is unique because it allows to me control manually wich files I will
	use for my commits, and it offers me the option to customize how I want to do the 
	commits in my projects
