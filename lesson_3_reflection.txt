When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I'm working in a project with other developers or if I need to have my repository online to use it in multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I think i'ts better if I decide when to pull the version because I might had added new local commits that may have conflicts
	with the remote repository
