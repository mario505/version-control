When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I'm working in a project with other developers or if I need to have my repository online to use it in multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I think i'ts better if I decide when to pull the version because I might had added new local commits that may have conflicts
	with the remote repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks are like clones of repository, but the new pushes that will be done will only affect
	the forked repository, it will never change the original repository
	clones let me make changes to a repository locally and then push them to the remote repository
	branches are changes that i need to test using the code of the main repository but 
	without directly changing the master branch, only when I decide that the changes in
	the branch should be merged with the master branch I will merge them.
